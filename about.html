										<h3>What is NFT?</h3>
										<p>
											An NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a digital asset that can be bought or sold but has no tangible form. One creates a digital certificate of the ownership of the asset which is referred to as “tokenization”. A record of ownership is kept on a  decentralized, distributed ledger called the blockchain. It cannot be tampered with as it is stored by numerous entities (computers/servers) around the world, employing a BFT protocol such as PBFT, providing resilience to the stored data.

										<h3>What is the hype?</h3>
										<p>
											In 2011, Nyan cat (an animated gif), was sold for over $500k. It is currently priced at $1,256,034. It’s not just art, the very first tweet made by Jack Dorsey is currently priced at around 3 million dollars. Given the worth and the scale at which the market size of NFT is increasing, we need a scalable and resilient blockchain fabric to meet these demands.

										<h3>Why ResilientDB?</h3>
										<p>
											ResilientDB is a Global-Scale Privacy-Preserving permissioned blockchain fabric, that allows its users to set up a blockchain application. ResilientDB provides an open source implementation of PBFT, a byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocol which we will build upon to develop a marketplace for NFTs. Furthermore, along with accuracy and security, ResilientDB offers a high-throughput yielding distributed ledger built upon scale-centric design principles to democratize and decentralize computation. As ownership is at the core of a NFT, we will bank upon the ResilientDB fabric  to maintain and transfer the ownerships  by storing custom smart contracts in the ledger.
